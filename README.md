# COE-005---Prediction-and-Machine-Learning
A repository on the codes utilized for the program Prediction and Machine learning during my 4th year college in the Electronics engineering program.

The codes are mainly run on Jupyter notebook or Google Colab. Files run on Colab are those requiring intensive RAM or GPU in order to process data such as GAN 
and Deep Reinforcement Learning.
